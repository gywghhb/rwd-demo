                <h3>Sound</h3>
                <p>Sound can be transmitted either directly as in (a) or via the alternating currents induced in a
                    moving coil microphone and received by a moving coil speaker as illustrated in (b).It’s also
                    possible to communicate using radio waves by simply amplifying the audio signal and applying it to a
                    suitable aerial as illustrated in (c). However, there are two fundamental problems in both
                    systems.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Only one radio station can operate in the region because the wave from a second operating
                        station would interfere with the first.
                    </li>
                    <li>The aerial required to transmit frequencies in the audio range (20 Hz to 20 kHz) would be both
                        very long and inefficient (the radio wave wouldn’t travel far unless huge powers were used).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both of these problems are solved by the process of modulation, the principle of which is illustrated
                    in
                    The image. In modulation, a high frequency wave known as the carrier wave has either its amplitude
                    or its frequency altered by the information signal in order to carry the information.</p>

                <h3>Modulation</h3>
                <p>Both of these problems are solved by the process of modulation, the principle of which is illustrated
                    in
                    The image. In modulation, a high frequency wave known as the carrier wave has either its amplitude

                    The communication model includes the transmission reception and processing the information as shown
                    in the basic communication model.
                </p>
                <p><b>Information Source:</b> it is that part of communication model which have some information or data
                    or the message which is to be sent. Information is measured in bits. It can be in the form of words,
                    pictures, video, codes symbols or any other type of data.</p>
                <p><b>Transmitter:</b> the message that comes from the information source is first converted into
                    electrical signal so that it can be transmitted for long distance communication. That electrical
                    form of the message is then processed and encoded. This information signal then modulates the
                    carrier i.e. it is superimposed on a high frequency signal. The transmitter transmits the signal
                    over the communication medium or channel using the transmitter antenna.</p>
                <p><b>Channel:</b> channel or transmission media is the path through which the processed signal travels
                    from sender to receiver. The transmission medium can be wired or wireless. While the message travel,
                    it may pick up noise creating unwanted signals that can mix with the original signal; thus, causing
                    the original signal to get distorted.</p>
                <p><b>Receiver:</b>it receives the signals from the channel, it accepts the signal, demodulates it,
                    decodes it, and removes all possible noise it had picked up. It is then further passed on to its
                    destination.</p>
                <p><b>Destination:</b> The demodulated information is fed to an electronic device e.g. loud speaker,
                    computer etc. </p>

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>The popularity of mobile phones means that large numbers of people use a mobile phone system at the
                    Sometime. However, the range of carrier-wave frequencies for linking between the mobile phone and
                    The base station is limited. Consequently, each mobile phone cannot have its own carrier frequency.
                    This means that the same carrier frequencies must be used by many mobile phones at the same time.
                    This is achieved using a network of base stations.</p>
                <p>The base stations operate on UHF frequencies so that they have a limited range and are low-power
                    transmitters. The UHF frequencies also mean that the aerial in the mobile
                    Phone is conveniently short! A country is divided into areas or cells, with each cell having its own
                    base
                    Station, usually located near the center of the cell. The aerial at the base station transmits in
                    all
                    Directions so as to cover the whole cell, but not to overlap too far into neighboring cells. In this
                    way,
                    The whole country is ‘covered’. Neighboring cells cannot use the same carrier frequencies, otherwise
                    Interference would occur at the boundaries between cells. A possible arrangement of cells is
                    shown.</p>

                <h3>Connecting Signals</h3>
                <p>Although each cell is approximately circular (depending on the flatness of the land), the cells are
                    shown
                    As a ‘honeycomb’ so that the cells fit together. The number in each cell represents a particular
                    range of
                    Carrier frequencies that would be allocated to each cell. Neighbouring cells do not have the same
                    range
                    of carrier frequencies.
                    When a handset is switched on, it transmits a signal to identify itself. This signal is received by
                    a
                    Number of base stations, from where it is transferred to the cellular exchange. A computer at the
                    cellular exchange selects the base station with the strongest signal from the handset. The computer
                    also
                    allocates a carrier frequency for communication between the base station and the handset. During
                    communication between the handset and the base station, the computer at the cellular exchange
                    monitors the signal from the handset. If the user of the handset moves from one cell to another, the
                    signal strength changes. The call from the handset is then re-routed through the base station with
                    the
                    greater signal.</p>
                <p>The caller speaks into the microphone. This produces a varying signal voltage that is amplified and
                    converted to a digital signal by means of the ADC. The parallel-to-series converter takes the whole
                    of
                    each digital sample voltage and then emits it as a series of bits. The series of bits is then used
                    to
                    modulate the chosen carrier wave. After further amplification, the modulated carrier wave is
                    switched to the aerial where it is transmitted as a radio wave.
                    On receipt of a signal at the aerial, the signal is switched to a tuning circuit that selects only
                    the carrier wave frequency allocated to it by the computer located at the cellular exchange. This
                    selected signal is
                    then amplified and demodulated so that the information signal is separated from the carrier wave.
                    This
                    information signal is in digital form. It is processed in a series-to-parallel converter to produce
                    each
                    sample digital voltage and then in a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) to provide the analogue
                    signal.
                    After amplification, the analogue signal is passed to a loudspeaker.</p>
