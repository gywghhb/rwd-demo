                <h3><b>What is color psychology</b></h3>
                <p>Color psychology is the study of hues as a determinant of human behavior. Color influences
                    perceptions that are not obvious, such as the taste of food. Colors can also enhance the
                    effectiveness of placebos.</p>
                <p>As by magic, human’s eyes and brain cooperate simultaneously to collect information. People decide to
                    eat or not a piece of an apple which is around their space of circumstance, and they judge it is not
                    going to rain today. It is fact evidence about these explanations that people already accept effect
                    of color; we decide to eat or not by eyes, and brain how much apples are ripening. Also, it is
                    general known that people are possible to analogize by seeing the weather’ color. In addition, color
                    constantly help our lives, and color’s emotion affects our mood. </p>
